**User Guide:**
-To access the application, please log in using administrator provided credentials. If you are using this application for the first time or for demo purposes, please use demo credentials below:

Username: user
Password: password

-To check what user is currently logged into the application, on the page (/mainscreen), view under the header the banner for "Current User," followed by the username.

-There are two primary sections on the home page: Products and Additions. Products represent items available to customers for purchase; additions represent items used to modify products and cannot be purchased directly by customers. The table in each section represents current inventory of each product and addition and its price. It also provides options to update the inventory or price, delete the item, or purchase. Each section offers the ability to add a new product or addition.

-Above each section is a filter. The filter is not case-sensitive and will search for matching items based on fragments. Search for all available types of cake in inventory by typing "cake", which is also a fragment and will include items like "cupcake" in the results. To narrow the search, add specific search terms.

-"Add": The user can create new products or additions by pressing the "Add" button above each inventory. This will take the user to the appropriate create form. Fill in the details of the new item (i.e. name, price, starting inventory, etc.). Associate additions to each new product; these will be the additions that can be used to customize each product.

-"Update": The user can update the details of existing products or additions.

-"Delete": The user can remove a product or addition from the database. Additions can only be removed if they are not associated to any products; please update products to remove the addition if it is no longer available before it can be deleted.

-"Buy Now": The user can create an order for a product by purchasing. This will add an order to the database associated with the username of the user who created the order, time of creation, etc.

-To generate reports on inventory and orders, navigate to the reporting portal using the link in the header. Generate a report of all orders, or orders by a specific user, or find a specific order by its order number. Reports are generated as a pdf that can be downloaded and printed for recording and audit purposes.
